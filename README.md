# Emotion Detection of Arabic Tweets Using Arabic Transformers

- **Social media platforms** have become an essential means for communicating feelings worldwide due to the rapid expansion of the Internet.
- People express their feelings and thoughts using **pictures, videos, audio, or textual content**, which has led to a massive amount of unstructured data.
- This **social media data** can be utilized for:
  - Preprocessing the data for **sentiment analysis** or **emotion detection**.
  - Emotion detection can analyze **sentences, paragraphs**, or even **entire articles**.
  - Detecting the author's emotions, such as:
    - **Sadness**
    - **Anger**
    - **Fear**
    - **Sympathy**
    - **Surprise**
    - **Joy**
    - **Love**
    - **None (Neutral)**

## Arabic Egyptian Dialect Nile University Dataset

- Consists of **10,065 tweets** categorized into **8 emotions**:
  - Sadness, Anger, Fear, Sympathy, Joy, Surprise, Love, and None (Neutral).
- The term "none" labels **neutral tweets**.
- Data collected from **Olympics hashtags** in Egypt (July-August 2016).
